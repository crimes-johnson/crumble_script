# crumble_script
A short and sweet *Apple* MacBook testing script. Most useful for pulling specifications from large quantities of machines or batch testing hardware.

Features:

Complete specification pull including CPU/GPU/RAM/Storage + Activation lock status, Serial Number, Last Boot Diagnostic result, battery health, etc.

Tree menus - only want to pull specs? Choose option 1! Skip straight to hardware testing? No problem!

Automatically opens hardware testing applications on the web and from the machine. Camera, microphone, speakers, keyboard, etc. 

Time/date stamping on file creation that logs system info and testing results.

Feel free to modify this script as much as needed. Looking for an iMac or Mac Pro script of the same kind? Check out cobbler_script:
